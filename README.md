## About Me
I am a Business Data Analyst with expertise in Python, R, Power BI, and Excel. I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive business decisions.

## Projects

### Project 1: An Analysis of the Crown Prosecution Service
**Tool Used**: R  
**Objective**: To analyze and visualize case data from the Crown Prosecution Service to identify trends in prosecution outcomes, demographic factors influencing case results, and areas for potential improvement in decision-making processes.  
**Description**: This project involves data extraction, cleaning, and analysis of publicly available datasets provided by the Crown Prosecution Service. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in prosecution rates, case outcomes, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity of defendants. Using Python, R, and Power BI, I implemented various statistical analyses and visualizations to provide actionable insights that could inform policy decisions and improve the efficiency of the CPS.

**Key Insights/Results**: 
Prosecution Rates: Identified a trend showing that certain demographic groups had significantly higher prosecution rates compared to others.
Case Outcomes: Found that cases involving specific types of offenses had a higher likelihood of conviction, suggesting potential areas for focused intervention.
Time to Prosecution: Analyzed the average time taken from arrest to prosecution, revealing a correlation between longer waiting times and lower conviction rates.
Recommendations: Suggested improvements in data collection and reporting practices, as well as targeted training for prosecutors to enhance decision-making and case handling

### Project 2: Census Income data
**Tool Used**: Python  
**Objective**: The task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50,000 a year or not based on a number of attributes.
**Description**: Used Python to investigate and train at least 5 ML models including Classification (to predict if an individual was going to earn more $50,000 annually or not), Clustering and Neural Networks. 
**Key Insights/Results**: The model achieved an 83% accuracy rate with the Neural network accuracy.

### Project 3: Coffee Shop Sales
**Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel 
**Objective**: The objective of the Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis is to provide actionable insights into the sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity of a coffee shop. By leveraging Power BI for data visualization and reporting, the goal is to help the business make data-driven decisions to optimize operations, increase revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.
**Description**: In this project, I analyzed historical sales data from a coffee shop, including details on transactions, products sold, time of sales, and customer preferences. Using Microsoft Excel, I built dynamic dashboards that track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as daily sales trends, peak sales hours, top-selling products, and customer segments.
**Key Insights/Results**: Sales Trends: Identified that weekends generated 25% more sales than weekdays, with a notable spike during late mornings (10 AM - 12 PM).
Top Products: Highlighted that espresso-based drinks contributed to 40% of total sales, with muffins being the top-selling food item.
Customer Segmentation: Observed that loyal customers make 15% of total visits but account for 35% of revenue, underscoring the importance of loyalty programs.

### Project 4: Toy Store Dashboard
**Tool Used**: Power BI
**Objective**: The Toy Store Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the store's sales performance, customer demographics, and product trends. The objective is to enable the toy store to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing by leveraging Power BI for dynamic data visualization and reporting.
**Description**: In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze the sales data of a toy store, focusing on metrics such as revenue, product popularity, customer purchasing patterns, and seasonal trends. The dashboard offers key insights into daily and monthly sales trends, top-performing toys, customer segments, and geographic sales distribution. It helps the business quickly identify growth opportunities, optimize stock levels, and tailor marketing strategies.
**Key Insights/Results**: Top Product Categories: toys account for 30% of total sales, while action figures and dolls contribute to 25%.
Seasonality: The holiday season in December leads to a 45% increase in sales compared to other months.
Customer Demographics: Parents in the 25-40 age group represent 60% of the customer base, with the highest spending in educational and tech-based toys.
